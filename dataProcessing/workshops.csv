Many of the workshops also questioned the agencies and legacies embedded in cartography. The image above is from a live-writing public workshop by @proforma.corps. 

This entry represents a workshop by proforma corps, who strive to use media-architecture installations to engage in site-specific conversations, reframe dialogue on neighborhood issues, and amplify solidarity, visibility, and legitimacy with the most vulnerable affected community members. These actions aim to bring about meaningful discourse on policy, design, and collective visioning capacity, as well as catalyzing attitudinal transformations surrounding social and community needs in the built environment. proforma corps, led by Bria Cole, is an open-format artist collective that creates and collaborates to organize guerrilla urban projection interventions in Tkaronto. Using visualization, media systems, and projection media, the collective aims to collectivize issues that benefit from public dialogue, fostering community engagement and awareness. Past collective members include Mark Francis, Blythe Haynes, and Sarah Keokkeok. 

""Deeply Liveable Neighborhoods"" refers to the details that create culturally rich neighborhoods, which contrasts with the monetization of city buildings. proformacorps presents a live writing station and projection event, welcoming all to share their memories, desires and dreams of a Tkaronto that is liveable beyond the market.
 
 The live writing station included a custom light box containing a pen, sketchpad. A webcam recorded the live illustrations and writing and sent the image through an open source Max patch to convert the video into a vector-based video and projected onto a surface in public space. This participatory event elicited responses to an accompanying animated prompt ""what makes a neighborhood deeply liveable?""",https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/du4mwjcip4vad1d621mmn/h/In%20Situ%20St.%20Clair?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1,,https://vimeo.com/756954257,

 door open, hand offered

 And a clear sky to rise my

Stride Gallery is an artist-run centre located on the traditional territories of Tsuut’ina, Niitsitapi,

Tsuut’ina Nation Youth Program (TNYP) operates from Tsuut’tina Nation, facilitating the Nation’s junior powwow and various youth programs. Since 2018, our organizations have been collaborating on a youth art program named Gumisistiy, which means “to persevere” or “to keep going” in Tsuut’ina.

Gumisistiy Youth Program tackles the question of access to art and reciprocal relationship
building between First Nations and art institutions. Our two organizations are building a lasting
relationship that fosters artistic growth and agency for the youth. Acknowledging the historically
racist and unsafe arts institutions, Gumisistiy connects Tsuut’ina youth and different art spaces
in the city through various art workshops. Artists lead programs to introduce their own practices
that are constantly expanding and reshaping what it means to be an Indigenous artist in this
moment. These artists offer potential role models and pathways to finding a creative voice and
self-expression for the youth. The program introduces ceremony to the colonial spaces, with the
intention of making Tsuut’ina ways of being porously present in Treaty 7 areas.

Stride Gallery is an artist-run centre located on the traditional territories of Tsuut’ina, Niitsitapi,
and Iyarhe Nakoda in Treaty 7, in a city colonially known as Calgary. Tsuut’ina Nation Youth Program (TNYP) operates from Tsuut’tina Nation, facilitating the Nation’s junior powwow and various youth programs. Since 2018, our organizations have been collaborating on a youth art program named Gumisistiy, which means “to persevere” or “to keep going” in Tsuut’ina.

Gumisistiy Youth Program tackles the question of access to art and reciprocal relationship
building between First Nations and art institutions. Our two organizations are building a lasting
relationship that fosters artistic growth and agency for the youth. Acknowledging the historically
racist and unsafe arts institutions, Gumisistiy connects Tsuut’ina youth and different art spaces
in the city through various art workshops. Artists lead programs to introduce their own practices
that are constantly expanding and reshaping what it means to be an Indigenous artist in this
moment. These artists offer potential role models and pathways to finding a creative voice and
self-expression for the youth. The program introduces ceremony to the colonial spaces, with the
intention of making Tsuut’ina ways of being porously present in Treaty 7 areas.

A statement from the organizers;  

""On the 100 block of East Hastings in what is colonially known as Vancouver, British Columbia, and which has many other names, including K’emk’em’elay, the Place Where the Maples Grow, the unceded lands and shared territories of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil Wau’tuth Nations since time immemorial, time out of mind - there is a garden.  

It is from here that we explore themes of community care, sensory respite, ground truthing, growing governance and ask: beyond survival, beyond isolation - What is 'enough'? What helps in the struggle? What can we accomplish in a season?  In a year? In a lifetime?  And, how might we envision a world beyond capitalist exploitation?  Beyond policing?

Currently owned by Concord Pacific, the previous structure on this land was torn down in the 1990s and the land has been 'vacant' ever since.  While waiting to maximize value of the land, developers are incentivized to convert lots into class 8 community garden or public park use for the substantial tax break, where the developer pays about one third of the taxes they’d otherwise owe.

These gardens are deemed short-term aesthetic contributions to communities and promote hoarding land rather than considering access to land as essential for survival, especially where there is a lack of accessible land with the explicit intention for cultural uses of medicine growing, reconnecting with language, sweat lodge and dualling as unprogrammed space for sensory respite alongside a gathering venue for ceremony, celebration and memorial where we celebrate the seasons and lay seeds and plants into the land along with the memories of our loved ones.  Where we learn how to restore the connections severed by capitalist and colonial exploitation and extraction.

Despite decades of care, we have no lease, no first right of refusal, no alternatives and a sluggish entry point into discussions on East Hastings 100 block redevelopment strategies.  We feel the precarity deeply alongside increased policing while the drug poisoning crisis continues and the ongoing shortage of dignified housing and options for self-determined healing remain stagnant.""",,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ky5fl7nke21i0fz1loqyw/Ground-Truth.jpeg?rlkey=znefljdavjafcob2hmqzle9b3&dl=0,,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tytovk4e9u5mue8aih17y/Phase-Change-1-12-Oct.mp3?rlkey=uty7vcsvmm6z6s7u0mshu3fpm&dl=0
