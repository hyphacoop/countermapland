This submission is from a workshop led by Reflex Urbanism. \n\nReflex Urbanism is an urban practice studio transforming the culture of cities. Reflex Urbanism understand, from experience, the complex nature of contemporary urban life. The same places marginalized people flock to marginalize us in return. Rather than call to centre the marginalized, Reflex uplifts power among the margins. Through relational research, planning, training, and action, Reflex addresses urban issues by and for equity-deserving communities.\n\nReflex is based in the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe territories known as Tkaronto, Ogimaa Mikana, and Toronto. As such, we are beholden to the Dish With One Spoon and Two Row Wampum covenants. Our studio serves those for whom these covenants also apply.

Each of these gatherings worked to map experiences and histories of the land commonly excluded from mainstream cultural heritage discourse. Many of the workshops also questioned the agencies and legacies embedded in cartography. This submission is from a workshop led by Gentle Geographies, Hives for Humanity and Keenan Marchand.\n\nA statement from the organizers;  \n\n\"On the 100 block of East Hastings in what is colonially known as Vancouver, British Columbia, and which has many other names, including K\u2019emk\u2019em\u2019elay, the Place Where the Maples Grow, the unceded lands and shared territories of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil Wau\u2019tuth Nations since time immemorial, time out of mind - there is a garden.  \n\nIt is from here that we explore themes of community care, sensory respite, ground truthing, growing governance and ask: beyond survival, beyond isolation - What is 'enough'? What helps in the struggle? What can we accomplish in a season?  In a year? In a lifetime?  And, how might we envision a world beyond capitalist exploitation?  Beyond policing?\n\nCurrently owned by Concord Pacific, the previous structure on this land was torn down in the 1990s and the land has been 'vacant' ever since.  While waiting to maximize value of the land, developers are incentivized to convert lots into class 8 community garden or public park use for the substantial tax break, where the developer pays about one third of the taxes they\u2019d otherwise owe.\n\nThese gardens are deemed short-term aesthetic contributions to communities and promote hoarding land rather than considering access to land as essential for survival, especially where there is a lack of accessible land with the explicit intention for cultural uses of medicine growing, reconnecting with language, sweat lodge and dualling as unprogrammed space for sensory respite alongside a gathering venue for ceremony, celebration and memorial where we celebrate the seasons and lay seeds and plants into the land along with the memories of our loved ones.  Where we learn how to restore the connections severed by capitalist and colonial exploitation and extraction.\n\nDespite decades of care, we have no lease, no first right of refusal, no alternatives and a sluggish entry point into discussions on East Hastings 100 block redevelopment strategies.  We feel the precarity deeply alongside increased policing while the drug poisoning crisis continues and the ongoing shortage of dignified housing and options for self-determined healing remain stagnant.\"",
