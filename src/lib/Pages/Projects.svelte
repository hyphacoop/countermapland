  <strong> cycle one: engagement workshops 2021-23 </strong>
</p>

<p>
  Between 2021-23, countermap.land distributed a series of micro-grants to
  artist-run centres and collectives across Canada to conduct a series of
  workshops. Workshop facilitators and participants were asked to use and
  critique a beta-test version of countermap.land. Varying in scale, approach,
  and pedagogy, these workshops and the resulting feedback shaped the current
  iteration of the project.

  “I think a big way of countering the settler-colonial condition is to give
  space for open-endedness, dreaming, and feeling. Bring these in conversation
  with a focus on Indigenous, Black and newcomer populations would give lots of
  space to not only critique the settler-colony, but also imagine (in the most
  active use of this word) alternatives. And more partnership-activations like
  this workshop will help keep the movement alive and growing!”

  “Proforma Corps strives to engage site-specific conversations, reframe the
  dialogue on these issues, and amplify solidarity, visibility, and legitimacy
  with the most vulnerable affected community members. Ultimately, these actions
  strive to bring about meaningful and impactful policy changes, as well as
  catalyzing societal attitude transformations surrounding the essential human
  right to housing and carceral state abolition.“

  “On the 100 block of East Hastings in what is colonially known as Vancouver,
  British Columbia, and which has many other names, including K’emk’em’elay, the
  Place Where the Maples Grow, the unceded lands and shared territories of the
  Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil Wau’tuth Nations since time immemorial, time out
  of mind - there is a garden. Over the growing seasons of 2022, we used the
  concept of countermapping as an opening discussion on how we might build
  collective power and to leave evidence that we were here and that it mattered
  - beyond property lines, beyond policy, beyond precarity. We explored the
  geographic principle of 'ground truthing', most often applied in cartography.
  Within the exploration of ground truthing, we asked questions to the land
  about sensory respite; accessibility; culture, language and medicine. It is
  from here that we explored the themes of community care, self care and growing
  governance to ask: beyond survival, beyond isolation - What is 'enough'? What
  helps in the struggle? What holds us together? What pulls us apart? What can
  we accomplish in a season? In a year? In a lifetime? And, how might we
  envision a world beyond capitalist exploitation? Beyond policing?”

  “countermap.land was the conceptual jumping off point for this project. We
  worked with artists Bruno Canadien, Sachin Sudra and Tsuut'ina Knowledge
  Keeper Kendall Jacob to share the idea of mapping and experiencing spaces
  around so-called Calgary through Indigenous perspectives. We visited Fort
  Calgary, a historically significant spot for Treaty 7 people, at the
  confluence of Bow and Elbow River. Fort Calgary and surrounding landmarks like
  the Deanne House, which is now a fine dining restaurant, are centered around
  colonial-settler narratives, but there are also historical events, stories,
  and myths of Blackfoot, Tsuut'ina and Stoney Nakoda peoples in that area. We
  walked around the spaces and listened to Kendall's stories and teachings, and
  also asked the youth to map the space via their own sensory experiences. The
  staff was tasked to update countermap.land as the Elders and Knoweldge Keepers
  preferred to deliver programs on site, without a technology component.”

  “Frustrated by the absence of applied radical approaches to spatial practices
  in the city of Tkaronto and beyond, this group formed to imagine and actualize
  the potentialities of a liberated city. Our mission is to transcend the
  limitations and harm of mainstream spatial practices that are rooted in
  colonialism, capitalism, and white supremacy by offering counter-mapping
  workshops, arts-based community-oriented interventions, knowledge-sharing, and
  community partnerships. We envision a future where the city becomes a site of
  fulfillment by providing equitably for the needs and desires of its
  inhabitants.“

  “The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NTRC) is located currently
  in a very colonial building at the University of Manitoba. There was
  conversation of if the location and style of this building creates barriers
  for people to access. For example – you would need to be very in touch with
  how the University functions and is laid out in order to find the building.
  There are no bus stops in front of the building so people would have to drive
  or walk a are distance.”

  “On a day that’s not a Monday, count the number of goji berries on the first
  bush you find. Purchase three meals that have that number from the menu at
  Double Greeting Wonton House or TeePee Treats. Take your meals to Kinistinaw
  park and share your food with the first people you see. Ask them what
  histories they know of this neighborhood, and in turn offer them yours. Offer
  gratitude and share with them what the land is asking of you. Ask them what
  the land asks of them.”
