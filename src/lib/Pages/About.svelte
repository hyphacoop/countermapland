    This project was initiated on territory occupied by many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples for thousands of years. Today T’karonto is home to many diverse Indigenous people from across Turtle Island. We recognize that although this land is covered by Treaty 13, colonialism is an ongoing process. *countermap is committed to working with Indigenous communities to expose, impair, and end settler colonialism.

    *countermap is a non-profit organization and collaborative platform exploring relationships between heritage and power. We work to;
</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Expand the definition of “monument” to recognize events, ecologies, histories, movements, and communities –including those which have experienced erasure; 

        </li>
        <li>
            Create space for reimagining monuments and futures that challenge dominant systems of power; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Disclose structural and ideological networks maintaining the current monument landscape through public-facing research;
        </li>
        <li>
            Explore practices in critical cartography through collaborations, commissions, and capacity-building work; 
        </li>
        <li>Support experimental cultural infrastructures that fight oppression.
        </li>
    </ol>


<p>
    *countermap is in progress. The map currently contains limited data and functionality. Although our project is currently limited to Canada’s settler colonial borders, we are building capacity to expand the project. Interested in collaborating? Discussing? Sharing? Contact us.
