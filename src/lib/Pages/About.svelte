This project was initiated on territory occupied by many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples for thousands of years. Today Tkaronto is home to many diverse Indigenous people from across Turtle Island. We recognize that although this land is covered by Treaty 13, colonialism is an ongoing process.

    Beyond this land acknowledgement, we are committed to continually questioning how countermap can work with Indigenous communities to expose, impair, and end settler colonialism.

    countermap.land is in progress. Although our project is currently limited to Canada’s settler colonial borders, we are building capacity to expand the project. We are also interested in projects that question cartography’s colonial roots. Interested in collaborating? Discussing? Sharing? Contact us.
