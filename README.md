## Code of Conduct

This project has a Code of Conduct. The Countermap.land project team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or technical skill level.

In order to try and remove obstacles to participation, we have adopted an explicitly-documented code to communicate our expectations for conduct within the community. We expect all people engaging with the project to have read the code. If you have any questions please email hello@hypha.coop.
